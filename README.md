### Automate Your Day Job with Python

Using financial records, I automated a process to analyze and produce an easy-to-read output making your job easier. The dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. I created a Python script for analyzing financial records to calculate each of the following:


The total number of months included in the dataset.


The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.


The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.


The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.


The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
